Sinatra-S3 is an implementation of the Amazon S3 API.  Based on the
Parkplace, written by _why, Sinatra-S3 has been extended to provide
additional support for ACLs, versioning and a bittorrent tracker.

Install
------------------------------------------------------------------

To install or upgrade Sinatra-S3

  sudo gem install sinatra-s3
  sinatra-s3 directory
  cd directory
  rake db:migrate

Or we could install from github (bleeding edge, may not work)

  sudo gem install sinatra builder
  git clone git://github.com/nricciar/sinatra-s3.git
  cd sinatra-s3/
  cp s3.yml.example s3.yml
  rake db:migrate

Optional Gems

ruby-git     - Enable S3 versioning support.
rubytorrent* - Enable S3 torrent support. 

* A custom version of rubytorrent is required to enable bittorrent 
  support. see http://github.com/nricciar/rubytorrent. 

Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Sinatra-S3 has been installed we can start our server and log in 
with the default username admin and password pass@word1. 

  rackup config.ru -p 6060

Once running log in with the username admin and password pass@word1 
via the control center at http://127.0.0.1:6060/control/.  Make sure
to change your password!

This version of sinatra-s3 uses Amazon's new subdomain-based API. That
means that buckets are treated as virtual hosts inside a domain, so
bucket test within the host localhost will be accessed as test.localhost.
That means that you need to either edit your DNS or your OS hosts file to
add hosts for each bucket you want to access. In UNIX-based systems, edit
/etc/hosts and add the hostname(s) at the end of the localhost entry:

127.0.0.1 localhost bucket1.localhost bucket2.localhost

You also need to use up-to-date versions of the Amazon client APIs.
